# Image_Classification_traffic_Signs

Traffic sign recognition is a challenging, real-world problem relevant for AI based transportation systems. Traffic signs show a wide range of variations between classes in terms of color, shape, and the presence of pictograms or text. However, there exist subsets of classes (e.g., speed limit signs) that are very similar to each other. Further, the classifier has to be robust against large variations in visual appearances due to changes in illumination, partial occlusions, rotations, weather conditions etc. Using a comprehensive traffic sign detection dataset, here we will perform classification of traffic signs, train and evaluate the different models and compare to the performance of MLPs.
